Blocks difficult to support:
    ForIterator, WhileIterator: executes a subsystem many times in the same 
                time step. Impossible to support in Lustre.
    S-Function: If it is C or Matlab code, it's hard to support.
                many basic blocks in Simulink has S-Function BlockType, we 
                support them using their MaskType (such as 'Bitwise Operator', 
                and 'Tapped Delay Line').
