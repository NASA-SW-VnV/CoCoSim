# GRAPHING_METHOD The method to use for generating an initial layout.
#   The method looks at blocks as nodes and signals as edges to build a layered
#   (hierarchical) graph which is then used to initially place the blocks.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    graphplot    use built-in MATLAB functions (compatible with R2015b and up)
#    graphviz     use Graphviz graphing algorithm (requires separate download)
#    auto         use graphplot if the MATLAB version is R2015b or above, else Graphviz
#
# Default is auto.
#
graphing_method: auto

# SHOW_NAMES Whether or not block names are shown.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    no-change    blocks names will remain shown/hidden without change
#    all          all blocks will show their name
#    none         no blocks will show their name
#
# Default is no-change.
#
show_names: no-change

# PORTLESS_RULE How blocks with no ports will be placed in the layout, with
#    respect to the rest of the blocks in the system.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    bottom    blocks are placed along the bottom of the system
#    top       blocks are placed along the top of the system
#    left      blocks are placed along the left side of the system
#    right     blocks are placed along the right side of the system
#    same_half_vertical    blocks will be placed along the bottom/top of the
#                          system according to which half they started in
#    same_half_horizontal  blocks will be placed along the left/right side of
#                          the system according to which half they started in
#
# Default is top.
#
portless_rule: top

# SORT_PORTLESS How blocks with no ports will be grouped, within the placement
#    described by PORTLESS_RULE.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    blocktype             blocks will be grouped by their BlockType parameter
#    masktype_blocktype    blocks will be grouped for each unique MaskType-BlockType pair
#    none                  no grouping is done
#
# Default is blocktype.
#
sort_portless: blocktype

# INPORT_RULE How inport blocks will be placed in the layout.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    left_align    inports are aligned along the left, unless there are obstructions
#    none          no special rule is used
#
# Default is left_align.
#
inport_rule: left_align

# OUTPORT_RULE How outport blocks will be placed in the layout.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    right_align    outports are aligned along the right, unless there are obstructions
#    none           no special rule is used
#
# Default is right_align.
#
outport_rule: right_align

# NOTE_RULE How annotations will be placed in the the layout. Annotations are
#    not associated with any particular block(s), so it is not possible to
#    infer where they should be placed.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    on-right    all annotations are moved to the right side of the system,
#                so they can be found easily
#    none        annotations are not moved at all
#
# Default is on-right.
#
note_rule: on-right
