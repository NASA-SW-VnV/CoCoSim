function fixDiagonalLines(systemLines)
% FIXDIAGONALLINES Remove diagonal lines by checking all pairs of points
%   and if the pair form a diagonal line segment, then redraws the line
%   with two 90 degree turns instead.

%   Inputs:
%       systemLines     Lines that are checked to see if they are diagonal.
%
%   Outputs:
%       N/A
