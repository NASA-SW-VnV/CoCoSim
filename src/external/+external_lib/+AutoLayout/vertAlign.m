% VERTALIGN Align blocks to facilitate the use of straight lines in connections
%   by repositioning blocks vertically. Currently only attempts to align blocks
%   which connect to a single block through an inport/outport.

%
%   Outputs:
%       layout          With modified position information.

    % Figure out which blocks to try aligning.

    % This should later at least account for 1 port on either side. Will
    % also need to update the while loop later as it assumes just 1 port.
