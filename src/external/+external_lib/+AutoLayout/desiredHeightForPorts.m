function desiredHeight = desiredHeightForPorts(block, varargin)
% DESIREDHEIGHTFORPORTS Determine a desirable block height to accomodate its ports.
%   Note: This function assumes blocks have not been rotated.
%
%   Inputs:
%       block           Full name of a block (char array).
%       varargin{1}     Desired space between ports. Default is 40.
%       varargin{2}     Desired space above/below the top/bottom ports of a block.
%                       Default is either 5 or 30, depending on the block.
%
%   Outputs:
%       desiredHeight   Block height required to accomodate its ports.
