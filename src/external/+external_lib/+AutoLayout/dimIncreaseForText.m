function [pos, xIncrease] = dimIncreaseForText(block, pos, varargin)
% DIMINCREASEFORTEXT Find the amount to increase the right and left positions
%   of the block in order to fit its text within it.
%
%   Inputs:
%       block       Full name of a block (character array).
%
%       pos         Current position of the block.
%                   In the form [left top right bottom].
%
%       varargin    Direction(s) to expand the block to fit its text:
%                   'left' - expand toward the left of the system.
%                   'equal' - expand toward the left and right sides of the
%                   system equally.
%                   Other strings or no input result in a default of
%                   expanding toward the right of the system.
%
%   Outputs:
%       pos         New position of the block.
%       xIncrease   Amount this block's width needs to be adjusted.
