function [pos, yIncrease] = dimIncreaseForPorts(block, pos, varargin)
% DIMINCREASEFORPORTS Find the amount to increase the top and bottom positions
%   of a block to reasonably accomodate its ports within it.
%
%   Inputs:
%       block       Full name of a block (character array).
%
%       pos         Current position coordinates of the block.
%                   In the form [left top right bottom].
%
%       varargin{1} Direction(s) to expand block to fit its ports:
%                   'top' - expand toward the top of the system.
%                   'equal' - expand toward the top and bot sides of the
%                   system equally.
%                   Other strings or no input result in a default of
%                   expanding toward the bottom of the system.
%
%       varargin{2} Desired space between ports. Default is 40.
%
%       varargin{3} Desired space above/below the top/bottom ports of a block.
%                   Default is either 5 or 30, depending on the block.
%                   NOTE: varargin{2},{3} are just used to determine a net
%                   height. The actual spacing between ports cannot be
%                   controlled.
%
%   Outputs:
%       pos         New position of the block.
%       yIncrease   Amount this block's height should be adjusted.

%
