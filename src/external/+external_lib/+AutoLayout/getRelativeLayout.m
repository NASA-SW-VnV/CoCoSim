function [layout] = getRelativeLayout(blocksInfo)
% GETRELATIVELAYOUT Find the relative layout of the blocks within a grid.
%
%   Inputs:
%       blocksInfo  As returned by getLayout.
%
%   Outputs:
%       layout      Struct describing the layout of blocks in blocks info.
%                   layout.grid is organized such that all blocks with the
%                   same j in layout.grid{i,j} have the same x coordinate at
%                   their centre, and such that the top position decreases with
%                   increase in i.
%                   layout.colLengths is created such that
%                   layout.colLengths{j} is the number of blocks in the
%                   grid with that j value (i.e. number of blocks in that
%                   column).
%                   The maximum j for layout.grid{i,j} is size(layout.grid,2).
%                   If (i <= colLengths(j)) then a block will be returned.
%                   If (colLengths(j) < i <= size(layout.grid,1)) then [] will be returned.

    % Ordering is based on the horizontal midpoints of blocks. The justification
    % of justifyBlocks assumes this and needs to be updated if it changes.
    [midXPositions, ~] = external_lib.AutoLayout.rectCenter({blocksInfo.position});

        col = isWhere(midXPos, midXPositions);
        colLengths(col) = colLengths(col) + 1;
        grid{colLengths(col), col} = blocksInfo(i);

%
%   Inputs:
%       val     Value to find.
%       mat1d   Matrix.
%
%   Outputs:
%       i       Position of the value, otherwise 0 if it is not found.

% Return 0 if val not found in mat1d.
    for i = 1:length(mat1d)
