CoCoSim (Contract based Compositional verification of Simulink models) is used to verify user-supplied requirements. The main objective of CoCoSim is to provide the followings:

* A **formal semantic** for a well defined subset of Simulink/Stateflow blocks. This formal representation allows the use of formal verification methods and code generation. It also can be used as a semantic of reference for other tools. Find more about the formal semantics of Simulink/Stateflow used in the [CoCoSim manual](doc/cocosim_user_manual.pdf).
* A **highly automated** toolchain: all the steps of verification or code generation are automated, check [CoCoSim manual](doc/cocosim_user_manual.pdf).
* A **Customizable** and **configurable** architecture: Currently CoCosim supports most frequently used Simulink blocks libraries (> 100 blocks) either by transforming them to simpler blocks or by direct translation to a formal language. The translation is customizable and extensible; new blocks can be easily supported.
* Full **traceability** throughout the analysis process. This traceability is crucial in reporting analysis results expressed in the formal model back to the user in the context of the Simulink model. For instance, the Counter-examples generated by model checkers is reported back to the Simulink level using a Signal Builder block to help the user debug the internal Signals values.
* **Scalability** to large models: abtained through the use of various verification techniques and compositional reasoning.

Cocosim has an open architecture allowing for the integration of different analyses.  The motivation is to support different verification techniques to scale to large models.  CoCoSim can generate C and/or Rust code. CoCoSim uses multiple model checkers for verification including Zustre, Kind2, and JKind. CoCoSim is currently under development. We welcome any feedback, contributions and bug reports.
