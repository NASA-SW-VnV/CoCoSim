CoCoSim (Contract based Compositional verification of Simulink models) 
consists of an open architecture, allowing the integration of different analyses. The motivation is to support different verification techniques to scale to large models. The main objective of CoCoSim is to provide the following:
* A **formal semantic** for a well defined subset of Simulink/Stateflow blocks. This formal representation allows the use of formal verification methods and code generation. It also can be used as a semantic of reference for other tools. Check [Simulink/Stateflow Formal Semantic](doc/formal_semantic.md).
* A **highly automated** toolchain: all the steps of verification or code generation are automated, check [CoCoSim Architecture](doc/cocosim_architecture.md).
* A **Customizable** and **configurable** architecture: Currently CoCosim supports most frequently used Simulink blocks libraries (> 100 blocks) either by transforming them to simpler blocks (see [CoCoSim Pre-processing](doc/cocosim_pp.md)) or by direct translation to a formal language (see [Simulink/Stateflow Formal Semantic](doc/formal_semantic.md)). The translation is customizable and extensible; new blocks can be easily supported.
* Full **traceability** throughout the analysis process. This traceability is crucial in reporting analysis results expressed in the formal model back to the user in the context of the Simulink model. For instance, the Counter-examples generated by model checkers is reported back to the Simulink level using a Signal Builder block to help the user debug the internal Signals values.
* **Scalability** to large models: abtained through the use of various verification techniques and compositional reasoning.

an automated analysis and code generation framework for
Simulink and Stateflow models. Specifically, CoCoSim can be used to
verify automatically user-supplied safety requirements. Moreover,
CoCoSim can be used to generate C and/or Rust code. 
CoCoSim uses various model checkers for verification (Zustre, Kind2, JKind).
CoCoSim is currently under development. We welcome any feedback and bug report.
