Front-End
=========

The front-end phase is splitted into two parts. A first one performs
model-to-model transformation, generating a preprocessed Simulink
model. Typically it substitute some blocks by an equivalent version relying on
simpler definitions. The second part produces an intermediate representation of
the pre-processed model.
