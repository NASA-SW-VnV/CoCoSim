### Dependencies
To install Dependencies, you can use our script that try to build all tools 
from scratch and download all libraries.


```
$cd "CoCoSim Path/scripts"
$/bin/bash install_cocosim 
```


this commande will install Zustre, Spacer, Lustrec, Kind2 
under `tools/verifiers/osx` if you are Mac user or `tools/verifiers/linux`.
ZUSTRE : `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/zustre/bin/zustre`
LUSTREC: `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/lustrec/bin/lustrec`
KIND2  : `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/kind2/bin/kind2`
If you want to use your version of the previous tools, go to `tools/tools_config.m`
and configure the tools paths. Or you can copy them under `tools/verifiers` 
as described above.

The command will also copy the standard libraries from Github to cocosim folder.
Which are `src/pp/std_pp` and `src/IR/std_IR`.
