### Dependencies
To install Dependencies, you can use our script that try to build all tools 
from scratch and download all libraries.


```
$cd "PATH_TO_CoCoSim/scripts"
$./install_cocosim 
```
install_cocosim script assumes the operating system provides:
    bash, basename, dirname, mkdir, touch, sed, date,
    cat, rm, mv, cp, ln, find, tee, patch,tar, gzip, 
    gunzip, xz, make, install, git

Also the following dependencies:
autoconf, automake, aclocal, pkg-config.

The script detects the missing dependencies that should be installed by 
the user.

this commande will install Zustre, Spacer, Lustrec, Kind2 
under `tools/verifiers/osx` if you are Mac user or `tools/verifiers/linux`.
ZUSTRE : `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/zustre/bin/zustre`
LUSTREC: `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/lustrec/bin/lustrec`
KIND2  : `cocoSim/tools/verfiers/osx/kind2/bin/kind2`
If you want to use your version of the previous tools, go to `tools/tools_config.m`
and configure the tools paths. Or you can copy them under `tools/verifiers` 
as described above.

The command will also copy the standard libraries from Github to cocosim folder.
Which are the pre-processing standard `src/pp/std_pp` and the internal representation
 `src/IR/std_IR`.
